Fundamentals of Web apps On macOS, open the Developer Console by pressing fn - F12 or option-cmd-i simultaneously. On Windows or Linux, open the console by pressing Fn - F12 or ctrl-shift-i simultaneously. Make sure that the Network tab is open, and check the Disable cache option as shown. Preserve log can also be useful (it saves the logs printed by the application when the page is reloaded) as well as \"Hide extension URLs\" (hides requests of any extensions installed in the browser). The \"Disable cache\" option in the Network tab of browser developer tools, like Chrome DevTools, temporarily disables the browser's HTTP cache for the duration the developer tools are open. This means that when you reload a webpage or navigate to a new one, the browser will fetch resources (like CSS, JavaScript, images) directly from the server instead of serving them from the cache. This is useful during web development to ensure you're always seeing the latest version of your website, especially when making frequent changes to your code. To refresh a webpage, on windows, press the Fn - F5 keys. On macOS, press command - R. If you want to loopup a hostname from an IP address, you can use the command dig -x IP .
